# ML_Loan_Default_Prediction_Classification  

**Name of project**: Loan Default Prediction Classification  
**Aim**: Build a classification model to predict the likelihood of a loan default case based on recent home equity loan application data.  
**Language**: Python  
**Solution**: Used various methods such as XG Boost, logistic regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.  
**Results**: The best model is XB Boost. The performance is Recall: 73%, Precision: 89%, F-1 Score: 80%, and Accuracy: 93%. Missing Debit-Income ratio has a high impact on the chance they will default on their loans. 
Predicting the possibility of a loan default case can be a useful tool in many real world scenarios such as Risk Assessment, Credit Scoring, Risk Analysis of Investors, and Regulatory Compliance.
